## 🧩 **Core Architecture Explained**

### 🔸 **Repository Pattern**
All Firebase + Hive operations go through a clean repository layer.  
UI never directly accesses Firestore or Hive.

### 🔸 **SyncManager**
Handles:
- Local data → Cloud sync  
- Cloud data → Local cache  
- Conflict resolution  
- Internet-loss recovery  

### 🔸 **Hybrid Online+Offline**
- Ranked quiz → Cloud  
- Everything else → Completely offline  

You can use this project as a real example of **production-ready offline-first architecture**.
